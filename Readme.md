## üìù Description
This project is a powerful SQL Query Generator built using Python, Streamlit, and Langchain. It allows users to input natural language queries, which are then converted into SQL queries and executed against a SQLite database. The results are displayed in a user-friendly interface, making database queries accessible to everyone - not just SQL experts.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Convert plain English to SQL syntax
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Clean and intuitive design using Streamlit
- **Data Loading**: Load data from CSV into a SQLite database
- **SQL Query Generation**: Generate SQL queries from natural language input
- **Result Visualization**: Display query results in a structured format
- **Real-time Processing**: Get instant feedback on your queries

## üîß Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Streamlit**: Front-end web application framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database
- **Langchain**: Framework for AI-powered applications
- **OpenAI API**: Natural language processing
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management

## üß† How It Works
1. **Data Ingestion**: The application loads transaction data from a CSV file into a SQLite database
2. **Natural Language Processing**: User queries in plain English are processed by OpenAI's language model
3. **SQL Generation**: Langchain converts the natural language query into proper SQL syntax
4. **Query Execution**: The generated SQL is executed against the database
5. **Results Rendering**: Query results are beautifully displayed in the Streamlit interface

## üîå Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-query-generator.git
   cd sql-query-generator
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run tts.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Enter your query in natural language and click "Submit" to see the generated SQL query and its results.

## üìä Sample Queries

Try these examples to see the power of the application:

### Basic Queries
- "Show me all transactions from January 2018"
- "List all transactions with Amazon"
- "What is the total amount spent on groceries?"

### Intermediate Queries
- "Calculate the average transaction amount for each category"
- "What are the top 5 most expensive purchases?"
- "Show me the total amount spent on each account type"

### Advanced Queries
- "Compare spending between the first and second half of the year"
- "Show me monthly spending trends by category"
- "What day of the week do I spend the most money?"

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know SQL to use this app?**  
A: No! The whole point of this application is to let you query databases using natural language.

**Q: What types of databases does this support?**  
A: Currently, the app works with SQLite databases, but it can be extended to support other SQL databases.

**Q: Is my data secure?**  
A: Your data remains local unless you deploy the application to a public server. API calls to OpenAI follow their privacy policies.

**Q: Can I customize the database schema?**  
A: Yes, you can modify the CSV import and database creation part in the code to match your data structure.
